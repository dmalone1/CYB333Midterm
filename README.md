# CYB333Midterm
Python socket communication &amp; port scanner project
For the midterm, I built a client-server socket communication program and a port scanner using Python. The socket program included error handling to manage issues like server unavailability, while the port scanner allowed users to scan specific common ports with input validation and delays to avoid overloading systems.

I encountered challenges such as managing client errors when the server wasn’t running and validating user input for port ranges. These were solved through exception handling and input checks.

I used ChatGPT to understand programming concepts but tested, modified, and expanded on all code myself—adding user prompts, formatting improvements, and delay mechanisms for ethical scanning.

I strictly followed legal and ethical guidelines, scanning only localhost and scanme.nmap.org. This project emphasized responsible coding practices and reinforced how automation tools like these can strengthen network defenses. It deepened my understanding of Python, networking, and cybersecurity best practices.
